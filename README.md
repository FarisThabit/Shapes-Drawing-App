Shape Information: For every shape drawn, the app provides useful information such as area, perimeter (or circumference for circles), and length of sides for squares and rectangles. For lines, it provides the length and slope.
Interactive Drawing: The app features an easy-to-use drawing interface. Users can simply select a shape and draw it on the canvas with their mouse or touch screen.
